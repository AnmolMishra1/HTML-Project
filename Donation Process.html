<li><h2>You’ll be asked to show ID, such as your driver’s license.</li></h2>
<li><h2>You’ll read some information about donating blood.</li></h2>
<li><h2>We’ll ask you for your complete address.  Your address needs to be complete (including PO Box, street/apartment number) and the place where you will receive your mail 8 weeks from donation.</li></h2>

<li><h2>If you’re donating whole blood, we’ll cleanse an area on your arm and insert a brand new sterile needle for the blood draw. (This feels like a quick pinch and is over in seconds.)</li></h2>
<li><h2>Other types of donations, such as platelets, are made using an apheresis machine which will be connected to both arms.</li></h2>
<li><h2>A whole blood donation takes about 8-10 minutes, during which you’ll be seated comfortably or lying down.</li></h2>
<li><h2>When approximately a pint of whole blood has been collected, the donation is complete and a staff person will place a bandage on your arm.</li></h2>
<li><h2> for  platelets, the apheresis machine will collect a small amount of blood, remove the platelets, and return the rest of the blood through your other arm; this cycle will be repeated several times over about 2 hours</li></h2>

<h1><mark>Refreshment and Recovery </mark></h1>

<ul>
<li><h2>After donating blood, you’ll have a snack and something to drink in the refreshment area.</li></h2>
